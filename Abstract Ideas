Question posed: WHAT IS THE HEAT EQUATION?
We are looking to imitate the appearance of heat flowing through a rod with a given length over a period of time. 
We do so by developing a few assumptions. Consider a rod of cylindrical shape, with two ends that are kept at a 
constant temperature. The rod is then heated for a certain amount of time in one spot, then begins to cool. 
We understand that the temperature of the rod can be represented by a function of just two variables. This is possible 
through making the assumption that each section of the rod (that are extremely small in width (dx)) share a consistent 
temperature. Through using techniques & methods similar to separating variables and implementing initial conditions
we will find a unique solution for f(x)=sin(x) and L = pi. The function is then computed given our two variables. 
Using partial derivatives results in a condensed version of our function. 

To start, our program will give a visual representation of a simple wave that, over time, we can learn to code these variables necessary. 

Our group consists of members studying applied mathematics. We achieve to gain a better understanding of partial derivatives and the heat 
equation, as well as, further possibilites we may achieve by studying these topics. This is one step into gaining insight of these topics
and we would like to share this with others for they may have not seen what mathematics can do. We hope that people will be inspired by 
what the heat equation can accomplish in terms of engineering, art, and mathematics.
