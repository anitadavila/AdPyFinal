This repository includes our initial project idea which we chose to alter over the semester, the definition of the heat equation (Abstract), and the code we have implemented to display a wave in which we seek to build off of as we continue our education as Applied Mathematics majors. We have also included code that we have studied off the internet to give us a better understanding of the heat equation and that we will use to drive further completion of this project. We learned a lot working as a team and downloading libraries necesarry for the progress of this program.
