WHAT IS THE HEAT EQUATION?
We are looking to imitate the appearance of heat flowing through a rod with a given length over a period of time. 
We do so by developing a few assumptions. Consider a rod of cylindrical shape, with two ends that are kept at a 
constant temperature. The rod is then heated for a certain amount of time in one spot, then begins to cool. 
We understand that the temperature of the rod can be represented by a function of just two variables. This is possible 
through making the assumption that each section of the rod (that are extremely small in width (dx)) share a consistent 
temperature. Through using techniques & methods similar to separating variables and implementing initial conditions
we will find a unique solution for f(x)=sin(x) and L = pi. The function is then computed given our two variables. 
Using partial derivatives results in a condensed version of our function. 

To start, our program will give a visual representation of a simple wave that, over time, we can learn to code these variables necessary.
