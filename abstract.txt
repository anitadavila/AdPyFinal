Project Idea:
Our project combines an interesting topic in mathematics and displays it's possibilies onto a program.
Our group will be working on Fourier Series and show how it is possible to make any drawing just bu
using sines and cosines. We will display (to the user) four different drawings. When the user has
picked a drawing, we will display the animation that goes into creating that drawing using the fourier
series. As the user is seeing the drawing they picked out being drawn using the fourier series, we 
will also display the process that goes into creating the same drawing. 
The process will include, how the drawing will be broken up into in order to create the same art in
terms of functions as well as, the series expansion that is needed to create the drawing. 

Final thoughts:
Our group consists of members studying applied mathematics and/or pure mathematics. We achieve to gain 
a better understanding of the fourier series, as well as, further possibilites we may achieve by 
studying this topic. This is one step into gaining insight of this beautiful topic and we would
like to share this with others for they may have not seen what mathematics can do. We hope that 
people will be inspired by the what the fourier series can accomplish in terms of engineerins, art,
and mathematics.
